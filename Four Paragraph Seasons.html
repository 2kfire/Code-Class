<h1> Winter Season</h1>

<p1 id="winter"> L</p1><p1>et start out with winter some may say they like the snow, some may say it has holidays benefits 
<br>,other say the work load is slower compare to other season of time. I used to like the snow in the past 
<br> for quite a fews years since we first come to the US because its American and I guess the weather is different
<br> compare to my home country which is Vietnam. Now if someone ask me do I still like the snow in the winter the answer would be no.
<br> there are many reasons for it just to put a simple one is that if you parking outside or even inside and during 
<br> snowstorm then it going to be happy clean your car event follow up plus the street side too.</p1>

<h2>Autumn Season</h2>

<p2 id="autumn"> A</p2><p2>utumn also known as fall season I called it the school season because that when school usually start around 
<br> september or getting for college new semester. If you work in the education industry I guess it pretty much mark 
<br> the start of the new school year , maybe not for everying teachers but pre-college it's pretty much become the norm in the US.
</p2>

<h3> Spring Season</h3>
<p3 id="spring"> I</p3><p3> n Japan they have the sakura starting to blossom in this season, its a beautiful season for the nature it self.
<br> In the US the cold begin to fade away slowly but surely and the weather become somewhat breeze and warmer by day.
<br> For me this is the travel season the new year holiday ( Asia) happen not so long after, alot of people booking their plan to
<br> back to their country to celebrate the holiday, and a chance to go to other countries too since the weather is really nice.
<br> I'm surely going to Japan in the future even if you don't know the language english is still work good there.
<br> the country and it culture are beautiful I bet their country side weather is as nice too.  
</p3>

<h4> Summer Season</h4>

<p4  id="summer">S</p4><p4>chool out ! The most anticipated time of the year especially for student. I think that in MA this season is the only season that 
<br> business is doing really good because the cold is gone daylight last long and everyone seem to be full of energy, especially young generation they
<br> they have that kind of free time more going out, even travel and all.
